I spent the last twenty years in the great city of Boston, mostly at
startups, writing software, architecting software, shipping software,
having fun helping companies to get off the ground <s>and run into the
ground</s>, changing jobs, hiring, occasionally managing people.

That's a lot of time to look around, think about things, form strong
opinions, share them with people around me. Time to start writing it
all down.

Beyond software, I like biking and sailing, not as sport, but as a
powerful way to [slow down](http://slow.andrewz.org/), clear my head,
start putting my thoughts together, become a better, more thoughtful
personâ€”and thus a better, more thoughtful engineer.

I am not actively looking for a job at the moment, but I am always
open to meeting new people and learning about cool gigs. If you are in
the area, drop me a line, let's get together for a cup of strong black
tea.
