Last time [we've established]({% post_url 2018-11-10-on-hiring %})
that it makes sense, when hiring, to look for a good overall fit
rather than some formal parameters, such as some specific skills or
the number of years of experience.

Likewise, that's how you should approach looking for a job as an
applicant: instead of concentrating on things like the size of the
compensation or specific technologies, try to find a place which fit
you holistically.

Now, a big disclaimer here is that all this looking-for-the-right-fit
approach only works if there is a robust market of workers and
jobs. Ideally, supply and demand are also balanced (clearly, not the
case today), but at the very least there need to be a large number of
*diverse* employers and a large number of *diverse* potential
employees out thereâ€”otherwise, there is really not much choice to
make. If there is only one shop in the town, you apply to work for
that shop, and if you are accepted, you feel happy and grateful.

If you are even a tiny bit ambitious, you also leave the town as soon as
possible, and move to a place like Boston, where there is, actually, a
lot of choice



Many people approach hiring as a sales process, from *sourcing the
leads* and *building the pipeline* all the way to *closing the
candidate*.
