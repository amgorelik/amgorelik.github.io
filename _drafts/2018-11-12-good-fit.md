Last time [we've established]({% post_url 2018-11-10-on-hiring %})
that it makes sense, when hiring, to look for a good overall ft
rather than some formal parameters, such as some specific skills or
the number of years of experience.

Likewise, that's how you should approach looking for a job as an
applicant: instead of concentrating on things like the size of the
compensation or specific technologies, try to find a place which fit
you holistically.

Many people approach hiring as a sales process, from *sourcing the
leads* and *building the pipeline* all the way to *closing the
candidate*.
